Olist is a marketplace that allows different companies to sell their products online. Many of them are small producers or traders with little experience in business administration. My goal is to help them identify potential ways to improve their sales and success on this specific marketplace. The client of this project are product sellers on olist and olist itself. The goal of my analysis is therefore to give some recommendations to the sellers on how to increase their sales on the platform.
